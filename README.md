# GnuWin32 Installer

## About
This tool uses the GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html.  This project utilizes https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html as noted here at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/faq.html#Id_like_to_redistribute_pre-compiled_packages_from_GnuWin32.  Each package has it's own license as this project utilizes each package individually jsut to give a standard installer.

## Purpose

This is project contains an NSIS script and installer for x86 Windows that are for the common GnuWin32 tools that I used on a regular basis.  This installer installs the GnuWin32 to the x86 Program Files directory, builds an installer/uninstaller, adds items to the registry to reference this to show up in Add/Remove programs, and adds the GnuWin32 /bin path to the standard user path.
